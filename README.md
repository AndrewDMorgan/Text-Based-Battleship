# Text-Based-Battleship

The game Battleship played in the terminal

#About The Game

I am currently working on another version of this in Java for my AP Computer Science class. This is a test version so I can write it easier in Java. The game currently has two players who take turns placing ships. You can also have the ships randomly placed. When placing you can't place ships ontop of eachother and can't move them off the board.

The game as of 8/19/22

# Future Plans

I may end up adding an AI to play the game. I will also be adding the Java version of this project soon. The Java version will be the same and currently needs the gameplay to be added. In the Java version you only can currently place ships (for player 1 and 2) without an auto place.
