# Text-Based-Battleship

The game Battleship played in the terminal



#About The Game

I am currently working on another version of this in Java for my AP Computer Science class. This is a test version so I can write it easier in Java. The game currently has two players who take turns placing ships. You can also have the ships randomly placed. When placing you can't place ships ontop of eachother and can't move them off the board.
(Future Plans Bellow)

The game as of 8/19/22

# Future Plans

I will soon be adding actuall gameplay where you can take turns trying to guess and sink eachothers boats. I may end of adding an AI to do it but I'm not sure yet. I am currently working on porting this over to Java (while refactoring some of the code to be more efficent as this is only a test version).
