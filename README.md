# Text-Based-Battleship

The game Battleship played in the terminal

#About The Game

I created this project for my AP Computer Science class. The first version was in C++ to figure out how to create the game. I also created a second version for the AP class in which we are using Java. The game currently has two players who take turns placing ships. You can also have the ships randomly placed. When placing you can't place ships ontop of eachother and can't move them off the board. You also can't guess on a spot you've already guess. You can sink ships and win or loose.

# Future Plans

I may end up creating an AI for this using branches to find the collective highest entrophy possible from a set of moves (I think this is how to descibe it). I have ploaded the final code for the Java version and from here I don't know what will happen with this project (possibly nothing).
